# Client Side Date Field Formatter

International date formats and timezones are a mess. Let the browsers render
date fields in the right localized format and timezone and stop worrying
about that on your site.

A typical use-case is an international event list, where the format and
timezone of potential participants is unknown.

Works automatically for authenticated and anonymous (with Javascript
enabled).
